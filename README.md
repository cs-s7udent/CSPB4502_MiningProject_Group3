### Description of the project: ###
This is preliminary trend analysis of the most frequently used programming languages and development tools of the last decade (from 2015 to 2024).
### Summary of the question(s) sought and the answer: ###
*What is the most frequently used language in the last decade? Could we find the trend of languages that have changed popularity in the past decade?*

JavaScript is the first most frequently used language of the last decade. SQL has appeared numerously in the top five most used languages of our analysis, which suggests that database management is extremely important. 
The findings show that Python and TypeScript have increased popularity from 2015 to 2024. 

*What are the most used programming languages for Full-stack Web Developers in the last decade? Would the result be the same for other occupations such as Mobile Developers or Data Scientists?*

The first most used language for Full-stack Web Developers is the same as Mobile Developers, which is JavaScript. The first most used language for Data Scientists/Machine Learning Specialists is Python.
Overall, there are some differences in the most used languages between occupations.

*Are certain languages and tools associated?*

JavaScript is associated with JavaScript libraries and frameworks (e.g., AngularJS and jQuery) and web development related languages and tools (e.g., PHP and HTML).

### Application of this knowledge: ###
The findings of this study can create and customize study guidelines for CS/IT related major students to help them enter the work force based on their career path decision. Moreover, the results also provide insights for developers who want to switch career path and/or strengthen their skillset. 
The trend of new popular languages can help educators design suitable courses as well as businesses to keep up with the latest technology. This also opens a good opportunity for researchers to investigate the cause of the trend.
